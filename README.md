# Memory Game Project

This is a project at Udacity FEND Program. Where I had to create Matching Game.


## Instructions to Play:

This is a game where you need to match pairs of cards. 
* Start the game by click to open two cards, if they match, try to find another pair of cards until finding all card pairs. 
* When the game finishes you'll see the winning message on the screen. 
* From that message you' ll be seeing your score, moves and time it took to complete the game. 
* Then on that screen, you can click on the repeat icon button to play again.
